<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<p>Rapid and simple access to high value hazard information is a key barrier to addressing disaster risk. Disaster risk management (DRM) activities, including the design of robust development projects requires the interpretation of data the describe natural hazards. These datasets are often highly technical and difficult for non-specialists in Disaster Risk Management (DRM) to find and exploit - these people are the primary users of ThinkHazard!. </p>

<p>The main aim of ThinkHazard! is to provide an analytical tool to facilitate improved knowledge and understanding of natural hazards among non-DRM specialists. ThinkHazard! provides users with a view of natural hazards in any project area, and relevant guidance on appropriately handling the threats posed by those hazards. </p>

<p>ThinkHazard! is developed and maintained by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery <a href="http://gfdrr.org" target="_blank">(GFDRR)</a>.</p>

<div class="c-box">
  <span class="box-title"><b>Getting Started</b></span>
  <p>ThinkHazard! can be accessed at: <a href="http://thinkhazard.org" target="_blank">www.thinkhazard.org</a>. Begin typing your location of interest (country name, region or district) and select the correct location from the drop-down. Hit enter, and you will be taken to the overview of hazards for that location. From there, you can view more detail on any of the hazards (including guidance on reducing risk, useful resources and contacts), and you can navigate to more specific and neighboring locations using the map.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

<p>User feedback is a vital component of ongoing improvements and updates to ThinkHazard!. Users are able to provide feedback on any topic concerning the tool, via the feedback form available on the user interface. Feedback is delivered to the administrator, who will action any required changes and log requests for new features. If the feedback concerns new data for use in the tool, the administrator will follow up to review the data suitability for ThinkHazard!. </p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>ThinkHazard! uses open-source code, available at <a href="https://github.com/GFDRR/thinkhazard" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>. </p>

<p>New versions can be developed using the open-source code as a basis, by including new recommendations and branding. Further, new functionality can be developed as required, and the tool linked to different data repositories.</p>

<p>Versions specific to an organization or sector can be developed using this code to provide coverage of particular hazards, or to tailor recommendations more specifically to sector requirements. Sector-specific versions of the tool may have damage thresholds tailored to that sector, for example, using construction standards for critical facilities to determine the intensity of event that could be considered damaging. </p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-this-guide">How to Use this Guide</h2>

<p>This guide describes the hazard levels shown in ThinkHazard!, and how the raw hazard data is classified into hazard levels. A general section describes the use of global and local data, and how the tool uses multiple sources of hazard data for the same area. It then presents sections showing the classification of data for each hazard in turn, because the method varies from hazard to hazard.</p>

          <h1 id="hazard-data">Hazard Data</h1>

<p>Data may come from numerous organizational and academic sources. They are generally of three formats:
* A set of GIS raster (grid) layers in which each grid cell represents the value of a mapped intensity parameter. One raster layer represents the intensity at a specific       associated with multiple probabilities of exceedance. 
* A set of GIS vector (point, polygon or line) layers that contain values of a parameter characterizing the intensity of a hazard, at a given return period. Layers of this type may be processed into raster format for use in the hazard categorization procedure.
* A single GIS vector or raster layer providing non-probabilistic hazard data (e.g., a susceptibility index). This type of data must be preprocessed before import to ThinkHazard!, into a raster layer containing mapped values that directly represent a hazard level. ThinkHazard! will directly map the hazard levels provided in the layer.</p>

<p>The first type is exemplified by Figure 2 1, in which earthquake hazard is shown as expected peak ground acceleration (PGA) with a 10% chance of being exceeding in a 50-year interval (return period of 475 years). Such maps are produced for different return periods, for use in projects that require estimated probability of loss or impact. For earthquakes, return periods of 475, 975 and 2475 years are common. A typical choice for seismic design codes for normal buildings is 475 years; longer return periods are used as the design basis for critical infrastructure such as hospitals, bridges or dams. This is because longer return periods correspond to a smaller chance that the design level will be surpassed during the lifetime of the structure, hence there is a lower risk of damage to buildings designed to those levels. A hazard map is the visualization of a ‘slice’ at a certain return period (or probability of exceedance) through a hazard curve, which is a graphical representation of hazard calculated for all points in an area. </p>

<div class="c-box-image">

</div>

<p>Figure 2 2 explains the procedure for the generation of earthquake hazard maps. 
Such maps contain valuable information about earthquake hazard, but rely on specialist technical knowledge for interpretation, making them unsuitable for communicating hazard to non-specialists in DRM. The hazard categorization process described in Section 2 translates the technical data (e.g., PGA) contained in these maps, into accurate but simpler hazard information. It translates this information into the degree of awareness that the user should have of the potential impacts of a given hazard on their project. </p>

<h2 id="hazard-coverage">Hazard coverage</h2>

<p>The following hazards are implemented in ThinkHazard! version 1 : 
1.  River Flood (FL): Overflow of a body of water (river, lake) that submerges land otherwise not normally inundated.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Earthquake (EQ): Shaking, trembling or displacement of the earth surface due to seismic waves or other phenomena of volcanic or tectonic origin.</p></li>
<li><p>Water Scarcity (DG): Water Scarcity originates from a deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time, usually a season or more. This deficiency results in a water shortage for some activity, group, or environmental sector. Different from other hazards in that it develops slowly, sometimes over years, and its onset can be masked by a number of factors. Water Scarcity can be devastating: water supplies dry up, crops fail to grow, animals die and malnutrition and ill health become widespread. Different types of drought can de distinguished (e.g. Wilhite, 2006): meteorological, hydrological, agricultural and socio-economic droughts. In ThinkHazard! drought hazard refers to hydrological drought, a shortage of river runoff, in relation to the population density.</p></li>
<li><p>Cyclone (CY): A non-frontal storm system characterized by a low pressure center, spiral rain bands and strong winds. Usually it originates over tropical or subtropical waters and rotates clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere.</p></li>
<li><p>Coastal Flood (CF): Inundation of land from coastal waters, due to high tidal levels, or storm surge. Storm surge is a temporary rise in sea level as water is pushed toward the shore by the force of winds associated with a tropical or extra-tropical cyclone.</p></li>
<li><p>Tsunami (TS): A series of multiple ocean waves generated by submarine earth movements, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or landslides.</p></li>
<li><p>Volcanic (VO): Volcanoes are vents in the surface of the Earth through which magma and associated gases erupt, and the resulting structures that are produced by the erupted material. Volcanic hazard comprises proximal hazards such as ballistics, lava, lahars and debris flows, in addition to the more distal effects of volcanic ash fall.</p></li>
<li><p>Landslide (LS): The movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. These encompass events such as rock falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows, such as debris flows commonly referred to as mudflows or mudslides. Landslides can be initiated by disturbance and change of a slope due to rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic activity, changes in groundwater, man-made construction activities, or any combination of these factors.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="global-and-local-data">Global and local data</h2>

<p>ThinkHazard! is flexible in the extent of data it uses. Data are considered ‘global’ if they cover the entire earth, and ‘local’ if their coverage is limited to a given number of administrative divisions. ‘Local’ data includes data that cover a region, i.e., several countries. </p>

<p>The coverage of a local datasets is taken into account into the processing following three steps, aiming at limiting hazard categorization to administrative units where there is actually data:
1.  Screening of the bounding box of the raster and selection of the administrative units that intersects the bounding box,
2.  If one administrative unit is only covered by no-data pixels, it is excluded from the selection,
3.  Mapping procedure (see 5.1.3) is applied on each administrative unit of the selection.</p>

<p>The data coverage map, accessed from the header menu of the tool, gives the latest level of data used for each hazard and country.</p>

          <h1 id="disaster-risk-reduction-drr-guidance">Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) guidance</h1>

<p>One of the most important outcomes of ThinkHazard! is guidance provided to the user, to help reduce disaster risk to their projects. This guidance consists of recommendations on how to reduce the risk to projects and links to further resources, such as data sources, event reports, or previous risk analysis relevant to that hazard and/or location. These are described in this section.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-to-reduce-disaster-risk">Recommendations to reduce disaster risk</h2>

<p>Hazard-specific recommendations comprise three parts:
*   A general text, the ‘core recommendation’ that explains the meaning of the hazard category name and encourages the user to take into consideration the risk in an appropriate way.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A brief statement on any impact that climate change might have on the hazard. This statement is linked to the hazard, and the country (or country containing the location) searched by the user. This captures regional variation in climate change advice.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical recommendations, consisting of a list of actions to be taken to reduce risk to the project. Each technical recommendation may be repeated for more than one hazard category, but higher hazard categories generally has a greater number of recommendations, comprising the more serious actions that are required to reduce the highest level of risk. Each technical recommendation comprises a short summary, which is presented on the user interface, and a more detailed section that can be accessed by clicking the hyperlinked short title.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The recommendations have been developed to provide guidance that minimizes technical language, and provides usable actions specific to each hazard. In ThinkHazard! Version 1, recommendations are not project specific, so they can be used for a variety of sectors. This component can be updated in other versions of ThinkHazard! to accommodate sector-specific recommendations. Users are able to propose additions or amendments to resources via the user feedback function in the tool. Updates to recommendations are then made by the ThinkHazard! administrator.</p>

<p>Initial recommendations were developed by the project team, which comprises hazard experts. This stage included development of the general text and short summary technical recommendations. Following review of the recommendations by the project team, GFDRR contracted external hazard experts to:
1.  Review the existing recommendations, 
2.  Develop new short recommendations as required to remove gaps in coverage, and
3.  Develop more detailed, 1-2 page recommendations to provide users with additional detail about actions to take. These remain non-specific to any project or sector.
Recommendations comprise static text, and can be updated by the administrator using the administration interface.</p>

<h2 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h2>

<p>The user interface includes a section providing further resources to the user. Further resources comprise links to documents, tools, and websites that provide information relevant to the hazard and country (or country containing the location) searched by the user. The resources may provide information on previous projects in the area, general advice on managing risk to a particular hazard, or provide a link to relevant agencies and tools for further analysis. The displayed resources are first filtered by hazard and location, then displayed in chronological order.
All further resources are stored on the same Geonode as hazard data layers, and retrieved periodically for use in ThinkHazard! </p>
