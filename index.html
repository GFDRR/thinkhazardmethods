<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<p>Rapid and simple access to high value hazard information is a key barrier to addressing disaster risk. Disaster risk management (DRM) activities, including the design of robust development projects requires the interpretation of data the describe natural hazards. These datasets are often highly technical and difficult for non-specialists in Disaster Risk Management (DRM) to find and exploit - these people are the primary users of ThinkHazard!. </p>

<p>The main aim of ThinkHazard! is to provide an analytical tool to facilitate improved knowledge and understanding of natural hazards among non-DRM specialists. ThinkHazard! provides users with a view of natural hazards in any project area, and relevant guidance on appropriately handling the threats posed by those hazards. </p>

<p>ThinkHazard! is developed and maintained by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery <a href="http://gfdrr.org" target="_blank">(GFDRR)</a>.</p>

<div class="c-box">
  <span class="box-title"><b>Getting Started</b></span>
  <p>ThinkHazard! can be accessed at: <a href="http://thinkhazard.org" target="_blank">www.thinkhazard.org</a>. Begin typing your location of interest (country name, region or district) and select the correct location from the drop-down. Hit enter, and you will be taken to the overview of hazards for that location. From there, you can view more detail on any of the hazards (including guidance on reducing risk, useful resources and contacts), and you can navigate to more specific and neighboring locations using the map.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

<p>User feedback is a vital component of ongoing improvements and updates to ThinkHazard!. Users are able to provide feedback on any topic concerning the tool, via the feedback form available on the user interface. Feedback is delivered to the administrator, who will action any required changes and log requests for new features. If the feedback concerns new data for use in the tool, the administrator will follow up to review the data suitability for ThinkHazard!. </p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>ThinkHazard! uses open-source code, available at <a href="https://github.com/GFDRR/thinkhazard" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>. </p>

<p>New versions can be developed using the open-source code as a basis, by including new recommendations and branding. Further, new functionality can be developed as required, and the tool linked to different data repositories.</p>

<p>Versions specific to an organization or sector can be developed using this code to provide coverage of particular hazards, or to tailor recommendations more specifically to sector requirements. Sector-specific versions of the tool may have damage thresholds tailored to that sector, for example, using construction standards for critical facilities to determine the intensity of event that could be considered damaging. </p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-this-guide">How to Use this Guide</h2>

<p>This guide describes the hazard levels shown in ThinkHazard!, and how the raw hazard data is classified into hazard levels. A general section describes the use of global and local data, and how the tool uses multiple sources of hazard data for the same area. It then presents sections showing the classification of data for each hazard in turn, because the method varies from hazard to hazard.</p>

          
          # Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) guidance
One of the most important outcomes of ThinkHazard! is guidance provided to the user, to help reduce disaster risk to their projects. This guidance consists of recommendations on how to reduce the risk to projects and links to further resources, such as data sources, event reports, or previous risk analysis relevant to that hazard and/or location. These are described in this section.

##	Recommendations to reduce disaster risk

Hazard-specific recommendations comprise three parts:
*	A general text, the ‘core recommendation’ that explains the meaning of the hazard category name and encourages the user to take into consideration the risk in an appropriate way.

*	A brief statement on any impact that climate change might have on the hazard. This statement is linked to the hazard, and the country (or country containing the location) searched by the user. This captures regional variation in climate change advice.

*	Technical recommendations, consisting of a list of actions to be taken to reduce risk to the project. Each technical recommendation may be repeated for more than one hazard category, but higher hazard categories generally has a greater number of recommendations, comprising the more serious actions that are required to reduce the highest level of risk. Each technical recommendation comprises a short summary, which is presented on the user interface, and a more detailed section that can be accessed by clicking the hyperlinked short title.

The recommendations have been developed to provide guidance that minimizes technical language, and provides usable actions specific to each hazard. In ThinkHazard! Version 1, recommendations are not project specific, so they can be used for a variety of sectors. This component can be updated in other versions of ThinkHazard! to accommodate sector-specific recommendations. Users are able to propose additions or amendments to resources via the user feedback function in the tool. Updates to recommendations are then made by the ThinkHazard! administrator.

Initial recommendations were developed by the project team, which comprises hazard experts. This stage included development of the general text and short summary technical recommendations. Following review of the recommendations by the project team, GFDRR contracted external hazard experts to:
1.	Review the existing recommendations, 
2.	Develop new short recommendations as required to remove gaps in coverage, and
3.	Develop more detailed, 1-2 page recommendations to provide users with additional detail about actions to take. These remain non-specific to any project or sector.
Recommendations comprise static text, and can be updated by the administrator using the administration interface.

##	Additional Information
The user interface includes a section providing further resources to the user. Further resources comprise links to documents, tools, and websites that provide information relevant to the hazard and country (or country containing the location) searched by the user. The resources may provide information on previous projects in the area, general advice on managing risk to a particular hazard, or provide a link to relevant agencies and tools for further analysis. The displayed resources are first filtered by hazard and location, then displayed in chronological order.
All further resources are stored on the same Geonode as hazard data layers, and retrieved periodically for use in ThinkHazard!
