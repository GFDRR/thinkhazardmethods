## River Flood and Urban Flood Hazard Levels
<div class="c-box">
  <span class="box-title"><b>Classification Summary:</b></span>
  <p>The methodology for urban and river flood hazard classification was updated for ThinkHazard! version 2. 
River flood and urban flood hazard are classified using a threshold of ‘area flooded to damaging intensity threshold’. 
The damaging intensity threshold is 0.5 m for both types of flood. The area threshold is 1% of the ADM unit for river flood, and 4% of the ADM unit for urban flood (due to the additional surface flooding included in urban flood, comparably larger areas are flooded)
Hazard is classified using frequency thresholds of 10, 50 and 1000 for high, medium and low hazard, respectively.
The full river and urban flood hazard classification methodology, developed by SSBN Ltd., is provided at the public <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7QVzSpnQtEnZzNUUFdNOWdLSXc?usp=sharing">ThinkHazard! Methodology Google Drive folder</a>.</p>

### Intensity
Flood hazard intensity is most commonly expressed as the water depth at a specific location, indicating severity of a flood. Flow velocity may also be given in high resolution local data but required a high level of detailed modeling. Think Hazard! is a global application, so water depth is used as the damaging intensity threshold. In determining a suitable intensity threshold, the European joint research project RiskMap  recommends four water depth classes: <0.5 m; 0.5-1.0 m; 1.0-2.0 m; and >2.0 m. The values represent typical thresholds for which significant changes in damages on buildings occur:
<ul><li>0.5 m: Flood mitigation by sandbags and other preliminary measures are no longer possible. This is a typical height of tables and light switches.
<li>2.0 m: The first floor and its interior are completely flooded.</ul>

A 0.5 m threshold is used; this provide a conservative damage threshold in line with the scope of ThinkHazard!. In version 1, global data used a threshold of 1.0 m due to concerns about uncertainties in the low-resolution elevation data leading to under- and over-estimation of depth at individual grid cells. Research by SSBN shows that at the ADM2 scale to which data are aggregated in ThinkHazard!, any errors seen in individual grid cells are largely cancelled out across the whole ADM2 Unit. 
In development of version 1 there was over-estimation of hazard when using a 0.5 m or a 1.0 m threshold. This overestimation was due to the presence of at least one grid cell exceeding these depths in most ADM2 Units, which resulted in a majority of ADM2 Units being classified as high hazard. After aggregating maximum hazard level to ADM1 and ADM0, most of the world was classified as high flood hazard. The updated methodology, considering the area flooded to a given depth threshold, overcomes the overestimation of hazard when basing the method solely on the presence of at least one grid cell exceeding the intensity threshold. 

### Frequency
The selected frequency thresholds for flood hazard are related to likelihood of experiencing flood in a human lifetime. This can be described as shown for the German Federal Office for Citizen Protection and Disaster Support (BBK, 2010; Table 3).
An alternative approach to using ranges of return periods, would be to interpolate between maps for different return periods to obtain a map for the required period. This requires spatial interpolation of hazard intensity, and uncertainties in the linearity of event boundaries and intensity distributions. Therefore, it was proposed to allow the algorithm to select a dataset within a range of return periods (100-1000 years). In version 2, the methodology explicitly uses the 1000-year return period.
The following frequency classes are used in ThinkHazard! version 2:
<ul><li>high: 10-year return period
<li>medium: 50-year return period
<li>low: 1000-year return period
    
 <br><br>
 <center><b>Table 3</b> Example of rationale justifying the choice of return periods, for river flood hazard</center>
    
<table><tr><td><b>Name</td><td><b>Return period</td><td><b>Rationale</td></tr>
<tr><td>High</td><td>10 years</td><td>In many cases a River Flood event of once per year or once every five years already causes considerable damage. NOTE: This return period may not be available in all flood hazard assessments. Therefore, it is proposed to allow ThinkHazard! to use 25 years as an alternative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium</td><td>50 years</td><td>An event that would, on average, be expected to occur once or twice in a lifetime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Low</td><td>10,000 years</td><td>An event most people will not experience and will only be remembered by previous generations. 
NOTE: Often the 10,000 year return period will not be available. It is proposed to use the highest available return period (and longer than 50 years) for the ‘Low’ hazard class. This can typically be between 100 and 1,000 years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Very low</td><td>Intensity not exceeded at the ‘low’ return period used.</td><td>No floods expected based on current climate, current models and data. However, some uncertainty remains.</td></tr></table>

### Other notes on methodology
Areas of permanent water are masked in the method applied, so river channels and lakes are not considered in the calculation – these water bodies would contribute large areas that exceed the intensity threshold, but due to their permanent nature cannot be considered as periodically flooded. The 3 arc-second (~90m) G3WBM mask (Yamazaki et al., 2015) based on multi-temporal Landsat images is used by SSBN to mask their 90m global flood product.
Urban areas were identified for the definition of urban flood. This was using a combination of two remotely sensed datasets indicating urban activity: the Global Urban Footprint (GUF)  and the 2013 NOAA DMSP ‘stable lights’ (NTLD)  datasets.

## Coastal Flood Hazard Levels

<div class="c-box"><span class="box-title"><b>Classification Summary:</b></span>
  <p>Coastal flood is classified using onshore flood depth data, provided as frequency-severity data in raster format. The methodology follows that described in section 2.4. The damaging intensity thresholds are 2 m for high hazard, and 0.5 m for low and medium hazard. Hazard is classified using frequency thresholds of 10, 50 and 100 years for high, medium and low hazard, respectively.</p>
</div>

Coastal flooding is caused by increased elevation of coastal waters above usual sea levels commonly caused by a combination of phenomena: Astronomical tide (natural cyclic sea level variation); storm surge during a storm or cyclone (raised water elevation due to low atmospheric pressure and accumulation of water due to wind); and wave set-up resulting from the energy transferred from offshore waves to the water column at coast. Storm surge hazard maps do not necessarily include the effect of tide and wave set-up, therefore may not encompass the full potential hazard.
The extent of inundated area and the depth of floodwater depend on intensity of the event and local topography. Extensive studies and simulation are needed to determine inundation parameters from wave data, since it requires an elevation model comprising both onshore topography and sea floor bathymetry. The ideal input to Think Hazard! is onshore inundation depth maps or inundation depth at the coastline to process the hazard categorization procedure. The former has been provided with global coverage by Muis et al. (2016), who have conducted this type of analysis for coastal flooding; this dataset provides the global coverage for coastal flood hazard in ThinkHazard! version 2.

### Intensity
Damaging intensity threshold is based on a similar rationale as for river flood. The values representing typical thresholds for which significant changes in damages on buildings occur are:
<ul><li>For low and medium thresholds, 0.5 m: Flood mitigation by sandbags and other preliminary measures are no longer possible. This is a typical height of tables and light switches.
<li>For high threshold, 2.0 m: The first floor and its interior are completely flooded. More threat to life occurs with this threshold.
</ul>

### Frequency
The selected frequency thresholds for flood hazard are related to likelihood of experiencing flood in a human lifetime. The following frequency classes are used in ThinkHazard! version 2 (unchanged from version 1):
<ul><li>high: 10-year return period
<li>medium: 50-year return period
<li>low: 100-year return period</ul>

## Water Scarcity Hazard Levels
<div class="c-box"><span class="box-title"><b>Classification Summary:</b></span>
  <p>Hazard is classified using a Water Stress Index, which reflects the availability of water per person per year – a measure of water stress based on hydrological drought and water use.
Water scarcity is the only hazard in ThinkHazard! that uses an ‘inverse damaging intensity threshold’. All other hazards are classified based on intensity value being exceeded. Water scarcity becomes more serious as the water availability decreases, so a lower water availability per capita per year translates to higher hazard.
Hazard is classified as high, when water availability is <500 m3capita/yr at the 5-year return period. Hazard is classified medium when water availability is <1000 m3capita/yr at the 50-year return period. Finally, hazard is classified low when water availability is <1700 m3capita/yr at the 100-year return period.</p>
</div>

Discussion is ongoing over how to best represent drought in ThinkHazard! – whether meteorological, hydrological, or agricultural drought. From version 1, it was chosen to represent drought in terms of water scarcity, using a global dataset of Water Crowding Index (WCI) (Veldkamp et al., 2015) based on water availability per capita (Falkenmark et al., 1989). This index is based on estimates of water requirements in the household, agricultural, industrial and energy sectors, and the needs of the environment.
Water availability data are available as grid rasters and are summarized per water province (a combination of catchments and administrative areas), as well as for several return periods (2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 years). Water availability is determined over these timeframes from an ensemble of five global circulation models (CMIP5), covering the historic period 1975-2004. This was combined with the population density in 2010 to determine the water availability per capita or Water Crowding Index (WCI) for the current situation.
Assumptions include: 1) This data includes surface water (rivers and lakes) and not soil moisture or groundwater; 2) Aggregation of effects to water provinces includes the effects of flow within a water province and the assumption that it is possible to mitigate drought by distributing water within a province (but not between provinces). Real water stress risks may be lower than represented by these data due to these assumptions. 
The rationale for the categorization choice is given in Table 4. Based on the return periods delimiting each category, the “best case” chance (1/best case Return Period) could be obtained.

### Intensity
It was estimated that 1700 m3 of renewable water resources per capita per year was a threshold, below which a country would experience water stress. For ThinkHazard! the threshold of <500 m3/capita/yr is used for high hazard, as it represents absolute water stress. Thresholds of <1000 m3/capita/yr and <1700 m3/capita/yr are used for medium and low hazard level, as these represent severe water stress and moderate water stress, respectively.

### Frequency
For each category of water scarcity (<500, <1000, and <1700 m3/capita/yr) and return period of original data, the average WCI in each ADM2 Unit was calculated. A trend line and corresponding (power) equation was fitted to this data, to obtain an equation with which the average return period of water stress could be calculated. The average return period and ‘best-case chance’ (i.e. longest possible return period) are related much like average and standard deviation. Both indicate how often water scarcity will occur in a certain water scarcity category, but the former represents the average chance of water scarcity occurring. The other represents the chance of a drought event occurring in the “best case” scenario where an area experiences water scarcity much less frequently than the average country of the same classified hazard. 
The following frequency classes are used in ThinkHazard! version 2 (unchanged from version1):
<ul><li>high: 5-year return period
<li>medium: 50-year return period
<li>low: 1000-year return period
    <br><br>

<table>
    <tr><td><b>Name of category</td><td><b>Best-case RP</td><td><b>Average RP</td><td><b>Best-case chance</td><td><b>Average chance</td><td><b>Rationale</td></tr>
<tr><td>High</td><td>5 years</td><td>2 years</td><td>20%</td><td>50%</td><td>This category represents areas where water scarcity is common but do not occur every year. Many countries in this category experience water stress every other year.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium</td><td>50 years</td><td>25 years</td><td>2%</td><td>4%</td><td>The 50 years return period was selected to represent water scarcity that occur once or twice in a lifetime. It corresponds to a large increase in number of water provinces which fall in this category.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Low</td><td>1000 years</td><td>250 years</td><td>0.1%</td><td>0.4%</td><td>Water provinces and countries in this category experience droughts less than once in a human life time, but they may occur occasionally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Very low</td><td>>1000 years</td><td>1*10^(24) years</td><td>0%</td><td>0%</td><td>In this category no water stress is expected based on longest return period under the current climate, current models and data. However, some uncertainty remains.</td></tr></table>

For each water province and available return period it was then calculated whether Falkenmark’s threshold of 1700 m3 per capita per year was met. In other words, for each water province and return period it was determined if water stress would occur. Figure 15 shows the number of countries with a WCI below 1700 m3 of renewable water resources per capita per year for several return periods. This graph is used as basis for the categorization.

### Results of classification
The resulting water scarcity map per water province and per ADM2 Unit is shown in the figures below. The analysis was made on water province level first, because it is assumed that within a water province (a combination of watershed and countries borders) distributing of available water will occur towards water scarce areas when needed.

## Tropical Cyclone Hazard Levels
<div class="c-box"><span class="box-title"><b>Classification Summary:</b></span>
  <p>Tropical cyclone is classified using wind speed, provided as frequency-severity data in raster format. The methodology follows that described in section 2.4.
The damaging intensity threshold is 80 kilometers per hour for all hazard levels, using frequency thresholds of 50, 100 and 1000 years for high, medium and low hazard, respectively.</p>
</div>

Cyclone data used for hazard classification is the UNISDR Global Assessment Report 2015 (GAR15) . Based on the metadata, the “tropical cyclonic strong wind and storm surge model uses information from 2594 historical tropical cyclones, topography, terrain roughness, and bathymetry”. Topography was taken from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) of NASA, which provides terrain elevation grids at a 90 meters resolution. 
The dataset covers the return periods 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 years, containing the peak wind velocity in kilometers per hour (km/h). No return period more frequent than 50 years is available from GAR15. Note that this data does not include extra-tropical cyclone winds, for example those that affect Western Europe. Also note that this data does not include the impact of cyclone-induced storm surges. Storm surge is available in another GAR15 dataset, but is represented in ThinkHazard!  as one component of a coastal flood dataset (section 8.2).

### Intensity
The intensity of cyclones is described by the wind speed, e.g., Figure 18. Based on literature review, an intensity threshold of 80 km/h is applied, which corresponds to the 50-60 miles per hour (MPH) hurricane warning threshold applied by NOAA (U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). The intensity threshold also corresponds to the Beaufort scale 9, described as “strong/severe gale – [at which] first damages occur”.

</div>

### Frequency
For cyclones, there are no community standards with respect to the frequency classes or return periods. Therefore, it is recommended to use the frequency classification as applied for river flood, based on human experience. However, as there is no global dataset with a return period more frequent than 50 years, the classification is as follows:
The following frequency classes are used in ThinkHazard! version 2 (unchanged from version1):
<ul><li>high: 10-year return period
<li>medium: 50-year return period
<li>low: 1000-year return period</ul>
