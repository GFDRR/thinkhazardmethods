# API instructions
### Extracting and re-using content
The ThinkHazard! APIs enable the extraction of hazard levels, recommendations, further information and contacts, into json files for re-use in other tools. 

## Reference
* DIvision codes: <a href="https://github.com/GFDRR/thinkhazardmethods/blob/master/source/download/ADM0_TH.csv" target="_blank">ADM0</a> <a href="https://github.com/GFDRR/thinkhazardmethods/blob/master/source/download/ADM1_TH.csv" target="_blank">ADM1</a> <a href="https://github.com/GFDRR/thinkhazardmethods/blob/master/source/download/ADM2_TH.csv" target="_blank">ADM2</a> 
* Hazard type: EQ = EarthQuake; VO = Vocalno; TS = Tsunami; CY = Cyclones; FL = Floods; UF = Urban Floods; CF = Coastal Floods; LS = Landslides; EH = Extreme Heat; WF = WildFires; DR = Drought
* Hazard level: LOW = Low; VLO = Very Low; MED = Medium; HIG = High

## List of hazard types and levels for a division

**GET** `/report/{division_code}.json`

To download all hazards ranks for one Administrative unit as json, use only the division code.
Example for Pakistan:

* ADM0 (Pakistan): http://thinkhazard.org/en/report/188.json
* ADM2 (Kandahar district): http://thinkhazard.org/en/report/3598.json

Returns the levels for all the hazard types for a division, e.g.

```json
[
  {
    "hazardlevel": {
      "mnemonic": "HIG",
      "title": "High"
    },
    "hazardtype": {
      "mnemonic": "FL",
      "hazardtype": "River flood"
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

## Complete report for a division for a hazard type

**GET** `/report/{division_code}/{hazard_type}.json`

To download the full information for a specific hazard whithin the desired unit, including the ranking and the text description, use the hazard code after the unit code, e.g. for floods in Pakistan:

* http://thinkhazard.org/en/report/188/FL.json

Returns the report for a division and a hazard type. Information includes: Data source, Hazard category and description, Recommendations and climate change statement, List of further resources, and Contact Information.
