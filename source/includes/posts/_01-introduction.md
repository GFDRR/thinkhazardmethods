# Introduction

## General
Rapid and simple access to high value hazard information is a key barrier to addressing disaster risk. Disaster risk management (DRM) activities, including the design of robust development projects requires the interpretation of data the describe natural hazards. These datasets are often highly technical and difficult for non-specialists in Disaster Risk Management (DRM) to find and exploit - these people are the primary users of ThinkHazard!. 

The main aim of ThinkHazard! is to provide an analytical tool to facilitate improved knowledge and understanding of natural hazards among non-DRM specialists. ThinkHazard! provides users with a view of natural hazards in any project area, and relevant guidance on appropriately handling the threats posed by those hazards. 

ThinkHazard! is developed and maintained by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery <a href="http://gfdrr.org" target="_blank">(GFDRR)</a>.

  <span class="box-title"><b>Getting Started</b></span>
  <p>ThinkHazard! can be accessed at: <a href="http://thinkhazard.org" target="_blank">www.thinkhazard.org</a>. Begin typing your location of interest (country name, region or district) and select the correct location from the drop-down. Hit enter, and you will be taken to the overview of hazards for that location. From there, you can view more detail on any of the hazards (including guidance on reducing risk, useful resources and contacts), and you can navigate to more specific and neighboring locations using the map.</p>

## Feedback
User feedback is a vital component of ongoing improvements and updates to ThinkHazard!. Users are able to provide feedback on any topic concerning the tool, via the feedback form available on the user interface. Feedback is delivered to the administrator, who will action any required changes and log requests for new features. If the feedback concerns new data for use in the tool, the administrator will follow up to review the data suitability for ThinkHazard!. 


## Technology
ThinkHazard! uses open-source code, available at <a href="https://github.com/GFDRR/thinkhazard" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>. 

New versions can be developed using the open-source code as a basis, by including new recommendations and branding. Further, new functionality can be developed as required, and the tool linked to different data repositories.

Versions specific to an organization or sector can be developed using this code to provide coverage of particular hazards, or to tailor recommendations more specifically to sector requirements. Sector-specific versions of the tool may have damage thresholds tailored to that sector, for example, using construction standards for critical facilities to determine the intensity of event that could be considered damaging. 


## How to Use this Guide

This guide describes the hazard levels shown in ThinkHazard!, and how the raw hazard data is classified into hazard levels. A general section describes the use of global and local data, and how the tool uses multiple sources of hazard data for the same area. It then presents sections showing the classification of data for each hazard in turn, because the method varies from hazard to hazard.
