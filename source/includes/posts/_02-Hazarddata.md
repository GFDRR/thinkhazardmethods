# Hazard Data

Data may come from numerous organizational and academic sources. They are generally of three formats:
* A set of GIS raster (grid) layers in which each grid cell represents the value of a mapped intensity parameter. One raster layer represents the intensity at a specific 		associated with multiple probabilities of exceedance. 
* A set of GIS vector (point, polygon or line) layers that contain values of a parameter characterizing the intensity of a hazard, at a given return period. Layers of this type may be processed into raster format for use in the hazard categorization procedure.
* A single GIS vector or raster layer providing non-probabilistic hazard data (e.g., a susceptibility index). This type of data must be preprocessed before import to ThinkHazard!, into a raster layer containing mapped values that directly represent a hazard level. ThinkHazard! will directly map the hazard levels provided in the layer.

The first type is exemplified by Figure 2 1, in which earthquake hazard is shown as expected peak ground acceleration (PGA) with a 10% chance of being exceeding in a 50-year interval (return period of 475 years). Such maps are produced for different return periods, for use in projects that require estimated probability of loss or impact. For earthquakes, return periods of 475, 975 and 2475 years are common. A typical choice for seismic design codes for normal buildings is 475 years; longer return periods are used as the design basis for critical infrastructure such as hospitals, bridges or dams. This is because longer return periods correspond to a smaller chance that the design level will be surpassed during the lifetime of the structure, hence there is a lower risk of damage to buildings designed to those levels. A hazard map is the visualization of a ‘slice’ at a certain return period (or probability of exceedance) through a hazard curve, which is a graphical representation of hazard calculated for all points in an area.

Figure 2 2 explains the procedure for the generation of earthquake hazard maps. 
Such maps contain valuable information about earthquake hazard, but rely on specialist technical knowledge for interpretation, making them unsuitable for communicating hazard to non-specialists in DRM. The hazard categorization process described in Section 2 translates the technical data (e.g., PGA) contained in these maps, into accurate but simpler hazard information. It translates this information into the degree of awareness that the user should have of the potential impacts of a given hazard on their project.

# Hazard coverage
The following hazards are implemented in ThinkHazard! version 1 : 
1.	River Flood (FL): Overflow of a body of water (river, lake) that submerges land otherwise not normally inundated.

2.	Earthquake (EQ): Shaking, trembling or displacement of the earth surface due to seismic waves or other phenomena of volcanic or tectonic origin.

3.	Water Scarcity (DG): Water Scarcity originates from a deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time, usually a season or more. This deficiency results in a water shortage for some activity, group, or environmental sector. Different from other hazards in that it develops slowly, sometimes over years, and its onset can be masked by a number of factors. Water Scarcity can be devastating: water supplies dry up, crops fail to grow, animals die and malnutrition and ill health become widespread. Different types of drought can de distinguished (e.g. Wilhite, 2006): meteorological, hydrological, agricultural and socio-economic droughts. In ThinkHazard! drought hazard refers to hydrological drought, a shortage of river runoff, in relation to the population density.

4.	Cyclone (CY): A non-frontal storm system characterized by a low pressure center, spiral rain bands and strong winds. Usually it originates over tropical or subtropical waters and rotates clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere.

5.	Coastal Flood (CF): Inundation of land from coastal waters, due to high tidal levels, or storm surge. Storm surge is a temporary rise in sea level as water is pushed toward the shore by the force of winds associated with a tropical or extra-tropical cyclone.

6.	Tsunami (TS): A series of multiple ocean waves generated by submarine earth movements, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or landslides.

7.	Volcanic (VO): Volcanoes are vents in the surface of the Earth through which magma and associated gases erupt, and the resulting structures that are produced by the erupted material. Volcanic hazard comprises proximal hazards such as ballistics, lava, lahars and debris flows, in addition to the more distal effects of volcanic ash fall.

8.	Landslide (LS): The movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. These encompass events such as rock falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows, such as debris flows commonly referred to as mudflows or mudslides. Landslides can be initiated by disturbance and change of a slope due to rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic activity, changes in groundwater, man-made construction activities, or any combination of these factors.
