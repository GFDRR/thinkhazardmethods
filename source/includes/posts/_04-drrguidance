# Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) guidance
One of the most important outcomes of ThinkHazard! is guidance provided to the user, to help reduce disaster risk to their projects. This guidance consists of recommendations on how to reduce the risk to projects and links to further resources, such as data sources, event reports, or previous risk analysis relevant to that hazard and/or location. These are described in this section.

##	Recommendations to reduce disaster risk

Hazard-specific recommendations comprise three parts:
*	A general text, the ‘core recommendation’ that explains the meaning of the hazard category name and encourages the user to take into consideration the risk in an appropriate way.

*	A brief statement on any impact that climate change might have on the hazard. This statement is linked to the hazard, and the country (or country containing the location) searched by the user. This captures regional variation in climate change advice.

*	Technical recommendations, consisting of a list of actions to be taken to reduce risk to the project. Each technical recommendation may be repeated for more than one hazard category, but higher hazard categories generally has a greater number of recommendations, comprising the more serious actions that are required to reduce the highest level of risk. Each technical recommendation comprises a short summary, which is presented on the user interface, and a more detailed section that can be accessed by clicking the hyperlinked short title.

The recommendations have been developed to provide guidance that minimizes technical language, and provides usable actions specific to each hazard. In ThinkHazard! Version 1, recommendations are not project specific, so they can be used for a variety of sectors. This component can be updated in other versions of ThinkHazard! to accommodate sector-specific recommendations. Users are able to propose additions or amendments to resources via the user feedback function in the tool. Updates to recommendations are then made by the ThinkHazard! administrator.

Initial recommendations were developed by the project team, which comprises hazard experts. This stage included development of the general text and short summary technical recommendations. Following review of the recommendations by the project team, GFDRR contracted external hazard experts to:
1.	Review the existing recommendations, 
2.	Develop new short recommendations as required to remove gaps in coverage, and
3.	Develop more detailed, 1-2 page recommendations to provide users with additional detail about actions to take. These remain non-specific to any project or sector.
Recommendations comprise static text, and can be updated by the administrator using the administration interface.

##	Additional Information
The user interface includes a section providing further resources to the user. Further resources comprise links to documents, tools, and websites that provide information relevant to the hazard and country (or country containing the location) searched by the user. The resources may provide information on previous projects in the area, general advice on managing risk to a particular hazard, or provide a link to relevant agencies and tools for further analysis. The displayed resources are first filtered by hazard and location, then displayed in chronological order.
All further resources are stored on the same Geonode as hazard data layers, and retrieved periodically for use in ThinkHazard!
