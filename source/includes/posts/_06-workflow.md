# Architecture and technical workflow
## Open source architecture

ThinkHazard! uses open-source code, available at https://github.com/GFDRR/thinkhazard.

The code can be replicated and amended to develop versions specific to an organization or sector. Potential amendments include including different hazards, or showing a subset of the present hazards. Recommendations may be tailored to a specific use (e.g., with a focus on managing risks in the agricultural sector). Additionally, the underlying method may be adjusted, for example by changing the classification of hazard levels; if the intended focus of the tool related to minimum building standards, it may be appropriate to revise the intensity threshold at which damage can be expected to occur. It is also possible to link the user interface to a different set of layers and resources on a different GeoNode.
